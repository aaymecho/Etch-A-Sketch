# Etch-a-Sketch

This codespace contains my implementation of the Etch-a-Sketch project, which is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The project is a simple web-based drawing application inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## Description

The Etch-a-Sketch project is designed to test my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application allows users to draw on a grid by hovering their mouse over the cells. The user can also adjust the size of the grid and clear the drawing.

The main objectives of the project are:

- Creating a grid of cells using HTML and CSS
- Implementing JavaScript event listeners to respond to user actions
- Manipulating the CSS styling of the cells to create the drawing effect
- Allowing users to adjust the size of the grid and clear the drawing

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the application, including the grid and buttons.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the appearance and layout of the application.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for drawing on the grid and handling user interactions.
